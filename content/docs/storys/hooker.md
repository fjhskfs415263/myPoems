她猛的醒了过来, 现在快到10点, 她要收拾衣服尽快回到学校. 她拿走了桌子上皱皱的500块钱. 一个多月的饭钱到手. 大学生应该赚得更多, 下次该要多点, 回去的路上她暗暗盘算.
 
 第二天手机上又有下一个男人. 一旦你开始了, 无论是人脉还是金钱都像树根一样蔓延, 慢慢的侵入整个脑子. 她坐着男人的车边开边想. 她还没来过一场车震, 这会是不错的感觉, 路过的人们会用看动物交配的眼神看我们. 鄙视. 一种本真坦荡的感觉. 那些四五十岁的老男人总是喜欢吮吸年轻的身体, 她也能感受自己的生命在被吸走. 每次连接, 冲撞, 新老白鼠的血液循环被缝合在一起的感觉. 她有些喜欢分享自己的生命, 他喝下她就像喝下耶稣的血. 喝多了, 便把酒吐满床单. 她看着床单上的生命, 像是便利店几十块的劣质红酒. 她默默擦去呕吐物. 完事后, 他沉沉睡去. 她好奇的看着他的脸, 等待他脸上的皱纹消失.
 
 在廉价酒馆的床上, 她看着这个男人睡着了, 满是毛发的大肚子, 头发斑白. 房间里的空气很舒服, 潮湿的温暖. 充满了爱的气息, 精液的气息. 这个年龄的男人很容易疲惫, 一次20到40分钟. 和别人总是难以高潮, 人们可能是喜爱连接的动物. 最有感觉的是刚进入的时候干燥的钝痛, 后来一切润滑后就变成润油的机器, 循环往复, 乏味得像每天的人生. 往后就连性也是乏味的. 只是孤独. 这个世上尽是麻木又孤独的人们.

She suddenly woke up. It was almost ten o’clock, and she needed to pack her things quickly to return to school. She took the crumpled 500 yuan from the table—enough to cover over a month’s meals. _College students should earn more; next time, she’ll ask for a bit more_, she thought to herself as she walked back.

The next day, her phone showed another man. Once you start down this path, whether it’s connections or money, it spreads like tree roots, slowly creeping into every corner of your mind. She sat in the car, thinking as it drove. She had never experienced certain thrills before; it would be interesting, she thought, though outsiders might judge harshly. A sense of raw honesty and openness came with it. Older men often sought out youthful energy, and she could feel her own vitality being drained in turn. Every encounter left her with a strange sense of shared life, a merging of old and new experiences. She found a curious satisfaction in giving a part of herself, watching the other person drink it in—intensely, yet fleetingly. Afterwards, she looked at the traces of the experience with detached curiosity, like cheap wine spilled on a sheet, waiting for the moment when it would fade.

Lying in a modest inn, she watched him sleep—his body marked by age, his hair streaked with gray. The room was warm and humid, filled with the presence of human connection. At this age, people grew tired easily; moments of intimacy were brief and often unfulfilling. The most striking feeling came at the beginning—sharp, unfamiliar, soon dulling into mechanical repetition. Day after day, life itself felt repetitive. Even intimacy had become monotonous. What remained was only solitude. The world was full of numb, lonely people.
