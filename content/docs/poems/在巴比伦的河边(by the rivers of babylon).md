My city was emptied by warriors,  
and they also found  
the paintings and words  
hidden in the temple.  
Their proud golden medals  
beat in this rubble-filled world,  
in the eyes of skin-and-bone children,  
alive as sprites,  
carrying fragrant food.

By the rivers of Babylon  
I found the painting—  
me, holding a revolver,  
aging, nude.  
The warriors recognized me and laughed,  
asking if I was honest  
about what lay beneath my clothes.  
Bread would be given to those of worth,  
so seize your youth, and 
trade it for much bread.  
The medals gleamed like the river 
Zion’s days once
filled my riverbed.
I hung the rope on a willow—  
those who live by exile  
how could they fear to flee?
