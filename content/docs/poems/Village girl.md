You can’t call me a fallen woman
I have never been pure--since I was nine.
I’m no widow,
no milk souring on a shelf.
I still want no man, and no man wants me.

Caged lesbians still pick men.
The wind is not from the sea—
it rises in the walls,
dry, dusty,
peeling skin, layer by layer.

There is always a bomb in the family.
Everyone moves with caution.
I make love with my rapist—
for freedom, for defense,
for cure, for waste,
for centuries of waste.

There is always a price.
Again, the village bomb goes off.
the price falls on them, never on me.
Time ticks—
seize joy, seize what matters?
Perhaps I’ll never learn.
