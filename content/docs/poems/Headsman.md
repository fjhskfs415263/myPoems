headsman, you gently wait for me.
I got this rope from a shop
It is strong and cheap
Next to bins of candy.

headsman, I ache to see you.
you tie this knot for me
Your hand like candlelight dinners
Zipping up the back of a lady’s dress

headsman, I run to you
You are soft like mom 
Like my dog's fur 
they've all gone for years now. 

headsman, If you want, I will.
I started when I was nine
I am naked, shameless and barren
You can say yes and soon I'll be gone.
