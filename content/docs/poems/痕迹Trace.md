I leave no trace of paper.  
The white beam of inspection comes unannounced.  
Children swallow crumpled notes,  
the breath of punishment choking in their throats.

Humans, too, have left their marks on earth—  
calloused skin scraping stone,  
blood rinsed away,  
bones left to dry.  
Erased lives  
still carved in memory,  
burning, stinging.

I never heard the trumpet.  
They had already charged ahead—  
students, workers, the old.  
They once existed,  
pulled the pin on their own lives.

Terror belongs only to the beginning,  
a few peals before the storm.  
Afterward, thunder grows frequent,  
as pale as rain.  
The cat crushed by the roadside—  
its only difference from man  
is how quickly the body is cleared away.

What lets one cross death?  
The battalion marching toward light—  
is the fall from the cliff  
nothing but wasted weightlessness?  
Like a moth diving into flame,  
some summons outweighs life itself.  
Perhaps that’s why our existence  
extends beyond the film’s opening scene—  
the maid scrubbing  
a dog’s excrement.

My first twenty years—  
a child in the corner, sucking fingers,  
rocking back and forth.  
I still do not love life,  
nor understand its meaning.  
But if this rising  
is merely a final flare,  
if I have only days left,  
I can still, at least,  
set a few cups and plates straight.
