- I slid into this place,
  Up and down.
  a buoy forgotten in the sea.
  When I am drowning, I am a swan.
  When I am up. I am numb as a log.
  
  I am the man in the village 
  who was blown in half.
  He slides to the worm's side
  Barely a man.
  
  I am a strong and lucky person 
  The bomb didn't destroyed my beating heart
  Pink orange, misty town
  black blue water.
  Gravity. anchor.
  
  Tell me it will be alright?
  I won't believe you.
  Tell me that's living?
  I won't believe you.
