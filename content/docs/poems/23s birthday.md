You reach your birthday,
taking another step into 23
24 is the age when
someone took their own life.

How mothers break
when they lose their children—
even if those children
were flawed.

How girls fell asleep
while their rapist climbed the stairs.
How endless the laugh 
when the death was revealed.
How students’ white T-shirts
turned into scarlet gowns.
How snow turns black
the moment it touches the ground.

How people filled the trucks,
pressed each other in a grip
to survive.
How children, alive
Someplace better
returned in dreams
with sugar still on their teeth.

In this deep well,
Your mother was also there—
spending New Year’s,
spending her birthdays
all alone.
Blowing out the candles
with a joy as inflated
as a balloon.
