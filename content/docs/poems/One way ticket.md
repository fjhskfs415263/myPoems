I got this ticket as a present on my eighteenth birthday.  
It came from my mother, unintentionally.  
She didn’t realize—  
relieving pain was far more important.  
It was booze to an alcoholic.  
I vomited. It was too much.  
Even after I was clean  
I still long for it,  
like the sky to a bird.

I was amused in strange days.  
The ticket is my shield.  
Ten thousand may fall at my side,  
but never on me.  
I am the bitch who takes hours in a bubble bath  
while you and the others wait outside the door,  
waiting to confront me with my damages—  
drinking, sex, money problems.  
My homeless story can’t buy your patience now.

I shave my legs.  
You pound the door.  
I walk outside in my bathrobe,  
elegant as a Nazi officer’s coat.  
You have called a doctor for my trial,  
but outfits can’t fool me.  
I walk out that door:  
cemetery, Elysian field.  
I always depend on the kindness of the ticket.
