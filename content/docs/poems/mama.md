People depict innocent girls
Picking primrose in the garden,
Until the flowers tumble from skirts 
Nothing compares to the joy of lifting their skirts 
And watching their white skirts fade to scarlet. 

I never knew 
There were people like mama
Who had milk inside them
After the thin, industrial milk powder,
I craved any nourishment. 
You came to me,
And I crawled toward you, 
Like a puppy forced to be weaned.

Mama is good
Even though she's sad sometimes.
Even though she can be cruel sometimes. 
Love is
When I kneel down to drink milk, you'll give me five yuan to buy a toy gun. 
Love is 
When I scream and kick, you remain calm, letting me be still.
Love is
When my white dress turns scarlet, you tell me it's okay. 
Love is
No matter how deep the bite marks, we still embrace—melting into one
Love is
When the world puts a straitjacket on you, we can still be naked in the room together.

And then you succeeded
At 24 years old
Much more successful than the time with the two hundred pills.
I don't know where you're buried 
I don't know how you died
I asked four times
She wouldn't tell me


One night, around midnight, while walking my dog
A middle-aged man stopped me in the dark
He asked me for my personal information 
Asked if I wanted to go to a bar with him.

I missed the old days
When everything that mattered was still out there in the world.
But reason told me the price was too high. 
So I stopped.

No more adventures
No more late-night singing
No more smoking and drinking
No more vomiting
No more screaming.
No hugs
No sex
No mama 
No dog
No home.
Life demands more and more of me. 
Everything feels increasingly empty now.



After you left, 
My scarlet dress turned rusty brown. 
It is getting darker now. 
So they made me shine,
Ordering me to choose a mate were hilarious. 

I tossed aside my past and future,
The unresolved issues
Along with my tattered clothes. 
My room was always a mess. 
Every time I came back from peeing,
Getting into bed was a problem.

I had to avoid the water bottle.
What is a first kiss?
Avoid mama's new shoebox.
What if your lover fears your blood?
Avoid the napkin.
I couldn’t remember my childhood.
Avoid the chair.
Avoid the slippers. 
Avoid the underwear.
Avoid the clothes. 
I collapsed on the bed,
Staring at the dark ceiling. 
When people die, they mostly see the ceiling.

The unweaned puppy was also crushed to death.
He had been hiding under the wheels.
He had seen his mother before and rushed to drink milk.
But she avoided him and was aggressive towards him for food.
They wanted to get another puppy, 
But the others had been sold to a restaurant the day before. 
Kind people mourned for the puppies. 
They blamed the bitch for giving birth to too many. 
Last year, this year, next year
The bitch would still be followed by a pack of male dogs twice her size,
And still give birth to a ton of puppies.
Whether she was one, two, or three years old. 
Her small size meant she would be dragged away when mating got stuck. 
Only the hour around 3 a.m. allowed her to wail.

I've never seen freedom 
I can't afford it.
From 8 to 23,
Time is like pills, 
Falling from the ceiling.
Snowflakes under the warm winter sun fell on my face. 
I still remember a photo of me when I was 6.
An orange cotton-padded jacket,
Dancing with a snowball in one hand.
Everyone treated me as gently as a child.
My smile was so sweet, it felt like I owned the world. 
So, Wish me a happy birthday. 
I'll be 24 next month.
