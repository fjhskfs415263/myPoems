[[绝望-不可逆, 脆弱感]],[[内省]],[[多情绪杂糅]]

You want to be free 
as I once did.
You cried;
Life has left you nothing but bruises.

You showed me your wings,
Transparent, fragile—
a baby bird 
trembling with urgent longing.

"Don't do it."
That's what they told me.
I didn't understand then; 
I still don't.   

What's done is done.
I followed that light for closure.
Those who choose to fly
often find a deep hole waiting.

Maybe you'll understand one day.
For now, wipe your tears;
Touch sweetness to your tongue;
Come back where you belong.
