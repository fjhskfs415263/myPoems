If it happens often enough,  
we learn.  
To a child,  
early education is not a toy.  
The brain and the skull, soft alike,  
mold easier than clay.

I am tied to a tree,  
indolent as a lady of leisure.  
Six handkerchiefs are my price.  
They call you a saint—  
spotless suit,  
clean-shaven chin,  
your silence roaring of human superiority.  
You draw swiftly, elegantly,  
as they pierce my chest again.

The earth is rich, yet food is scarce.  
Man and livestock differ little—  
for meat, for sex, for labor.  
If possible, perhaps,  
I am a lipstick-wearing ape,  
a sheep upon the deck,  
the chosen queen bee,  
a cow of perpetual milk.

I watch my kin  
hack off my limbs,  
each holding a precious handkerchief,  
roasting a piece of my flesh.  
If I still had feet,  
I would curl my toes—  
lived so long,  
yet gained not the fat of a pig.

Some handkerchiefs are beer.  
People give birth,  
then sell their daughters.  
Each birth  
arrives with vast pain.  
When pain spreads worldwide,  
it becomes ordinary,  
like weeds.

In Rome, I wear a metal collar.  
On plantations, my body is scarred.  
The Gulag’s uniform,  
the camp’s tattooed number.  
I cannot press myself out the fence of family love,  
nor squeeze into the anti-migrant walls.  
I cannot escape parasites or hunger.  
So I go on,  
drinking hormones in the slaughterhouse.

Death spares no one,  
not even you.  
Before your last breath,  
you stare at the ceiling,  
shouting: “The horror! The horror!”
I think infants see that thing too—  
that’s why,  
the moment they arrive,  
they wail.
