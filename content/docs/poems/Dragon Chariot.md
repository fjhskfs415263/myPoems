Some called you mad,
some said dreadfully brave.
You wrapped my shroud in gold—
my mother, half-god.

Father wept,
a heroic man,
howling for what cannot return.
Your rage and love tear a hole in me,
my mother, my murderer.

I was born with a leash.
First, his.
Now, yours.
The divorce papers never asked me.
He wanted a boy—
and I am not.

Life knows no mercy.
I seek the quick of mercy.
Life can be a slow poison.
The man unveils his kindness,
flings coins and curses at our faces.
Clever, he thrives.
I am the easy one.

But what’s the point?
I blaze like the sun.
I am far beyond this world.
