Baby is holy, baby is loving.  
A mother is tormented  
when asked why she brought them here.

You are the child of cousins.
I am my mother's child.
You and I may have a child.
Child is sperm left in a vagina.

Giving Child is female’s job
They swell like queen ant, delivering miracles,
Miracles can be queens, sperms, workers, or honey barrels.
They pick teeth with toothpicks
Says pain is Inevitable.

In funeral parties, family meetings, car seats
villagers asked me to marry in my twenties,
because their sons are tall and rich.
They taught the next generation to multiply like me,
to give birth until the house turns into a kindergarten.

Women get married in gray garages,
old people bless in silence,
and cooks bring naked Barbies
under meat covers for celebration.

At school, a girl said she was pregnant.
Her boyfriend was to marry within days.
A teacher yelled:  "Why don’t you give birth now?"
My mother had a stillborn in her forties. 

Experts convince women to obey—
Have more children.
child gives birth to child—
In the battlefield, Molotov in hand.

I said I may abuse the child,
because oxygen is running out.
A friend's mother wished to die,
and first to hang her child.

Baby stands before my hanging.  
I dream of my dog—he limps to comfort me,  
tail wagging; I twist his neck.  
Baby is what they cannot bear,  
because of forced sterilization.

Child of mother. Child of family
Child of race, Child of nation 
Child of Hitler, Child of Stalin.
Child of peace, Child of war.

We are not solid.
Every century, flushed away.
Our existence: 
a child never in my womb.
