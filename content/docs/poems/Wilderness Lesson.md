Hunger taught me no lesson,
nor did the dog's death.
Rain has extinguished the flames
leaving my city walls decadent 
with charcoal.
I wandered the wilderness;
I can still see the world without my eyes.

That dog who saved me from the cliff 
was gone.
Soon you replaced him with 
another dog as a gift.
He was still unweaned,
and drifted away within days.

Now you set a feast at the door
and call me home--
Because that's what families do.
Such offsets do me no good.
Is there another Troy for you to burn?
