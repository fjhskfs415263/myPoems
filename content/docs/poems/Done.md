done. I say.
Everyone leaves,
slips through the door.

The river comes and  goes.
Leaves green, then fall —
some only earlier.

I greet you,
you who remain,
next generations:
may health stand at your side,
may you glitter
even on the riverbed.

I have tasted bitter, tasted sweet,
set my brick into the wall.
It is your time.
I go now.

done. I'd say
Everyone leaves
And walk out that door.
River flew in and out
Leaf grow green and fall
Some just happened earlier.

Greet you,
Those who live and next generations 
May health stands by you
May you glitter on the river bed
I've tasted the bitter and sweet.
And placed the brick in the wall
It's your time.
And I shall leave now.
