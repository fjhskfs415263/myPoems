The teacher once said —  
nowadays, things are advanced:  
even pigs die painlessly,  
electrocuted,  
without knowing,  
without struggle.  
Ignorance, and brevity — how enviable.  
My poverty is embarrassing.  
Living, I’m less than human;  
dying, I’m less than a pig.  
All I have is a rope.

My legs would flee the rigor of death,  
for freedom always comes with a price.  
Winter. The wasteland.  
I search for roots,  
chew on soil —  
hunger always drives one to choose.  
They say the rope is painless too,  
but “painless” was never true.  
Death is an entrance ticket,  
and every show requires a fee.

Again, I knocked on my family’s door.  
Of course, they would embrace me,  
rejoicing at my return:  
first, because the time was right,  
and second, because in hunger and cold  
I learned loyalty.

Diligence overflows with happiness.  
They stuffed my shredded flesh  
into my own intestines,  
hung the work high,  
where wind and salt conspire—  
before rot settles home,  
they trample out the water,  
let fat blend with muscle.  
I sway,  
brewing the sweetness of the New Year.

My head, too, hangs on an iron hook,  
watching both life and its end—  
speechless now,  
without island or flies,  
eternally smiling:  
the mask of a pig’s head.

When New Year guests arrive,  
I’ll be sliced and steamed,  
no salt needed—perhaps an egg for garnish.  
I shall release, from over twenty years,  
my natural savor.  
Everyone will lick their lips,  
pat their bellies,  
and praise this rebellious delicacy.
