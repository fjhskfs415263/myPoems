I said I do not fear death,
as poets and philosophers said,
while storms approach.
Yet fear waits
when you finally meet it—
when pain and the void arrive.
All knowledge fails.
Under rolling thunder,
we are lost as infants.

Fear is what they used
in the camp:
electric stun, handcuffs, tiger chair.
Boots on our faces,
they kick us back into our bodies,
along with truth and our reaching tentacles.
Our souls shrink like snails.

Insecticide cannot destroy us,
nor sterilization.
There will be
rage, injustice,
turning us into a red dragon.
We tear most of ourselves down—
and become infants again.

The future—
will it be without fear?
