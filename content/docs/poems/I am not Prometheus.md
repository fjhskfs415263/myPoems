She always shifts the fault to me.  
She slips a blade into the seams of Egypt’s pyramids.  
When she speaks from the heart, I must listen in kind.  
She probes beneath my skin,  
and leaves love careening through my ribcage.  
Creatures mend only to survive;  
She delights in my intactness. 
That means silence—  
and it means she can strike harder next time.  
But I am not Prometheus:  
the wound will not be whole by morning.  
We have but one set of organs;  
lose one, and it never grows back.
