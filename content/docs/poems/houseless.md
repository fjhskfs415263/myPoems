I wouldn’t call myself homeless—  
at least I can still look at it  
every day.

I’m still stranded on the beach,  
living off trash and dead fish.  
Someday, I’ll grow wings  
and fly toward the line  
where heaven meets the earth.

I once curled inside a tent of art,  
and called it home.  
That’s what the living call virtue—  
_Death is not a solution,_  
_You must find hope._

What is hope?  
Hunger won’t blow my tent away,  
wear won’t drip through its roof,  
no knife slits its door at night,  
no one drives me out anymore.

Erasure is never that simple.  
They wiped out  
one fourth of the Jews—  
harder, perhaps,  
than cleansing themselves.

This illness has followed me  
for over ten years.  
Soup won’t cure it,  
a tent won’t cure it.  
I think I inherited  
a landlord’s greed,  
and still can’t feel  
the beauty of being alive.

I have limbs. I am still breathing.  
Yet I keep gazing at the far shore—  
and in the wind  
echoes the bitterness  
of _From the New World._
