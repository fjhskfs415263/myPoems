Before their daughters turn eighteen,  
people guard their chastity  
like pearls.  
They lock them in copper towers,  
click —  
the sound of assurance,  
the most solid guarantee.

But people forget the cracks.  
Flies slip in.  
I often think I am a living corpse,  
fragrant since the age of nine.  
They are not kitchen gentlemen,  
not ones who heed a waving hand.  
They come from tropical savannas,  
they burrow through skin,  
their thirst for blood outlives death.

Your art gives birth upon my body—  
white, tadpole-like lives.  
“This is nourishment, this is seed.  
Pure pleasure. Golden rain.”  
you said.  
Is all art erotic?  
It used to be paintings, now it is the lens.
Artists fix their focus on the receiver,  
erection, convulsion,  
Insects mating,  
surging tides.  
the splendor of legs flung open.

I am not a good actress.  
Directors smash their cameras in rage—  
I never give any reaction.  
So they unite,  
needles probing my spinal cord,  
yet my legs only kick—  
mechanical, lifeless, reflexive.  
The mistake lies  
in expecting a response from still life.

Living beings are supple;  
still things hold other worth.  
Your seeds in my flesh hatch into little flies—  
a perfect harmony of mission and act:  
one flies, one breeds.  
The biological golden ratio.  
You call it golden rain?  
I call it urine.  
And my father’s fear included—  
the one locked in the copper house  
was never me.  
Of course he’ll be overthrown,  
but not by you,  
nor by my little flies,  
nor by the Furies of revenge—  
by himself.
