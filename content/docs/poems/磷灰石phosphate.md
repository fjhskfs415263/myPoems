People’s lives begin  
at the crater,  
on a forty-five-degree slope.  
Most slide downward backward.  
Production always manages  
to deliver children  
to the top of the slope.

I have slipped one-fifth of the way.  
My parents grasp my long hair  
to slow their own aging fatigue.  
One day their legs cramp,  
and they tumble faster.  
They clutch the insurance—  
more fragile than straw,  
tied to soil and roots—  
they slide into the volcano,  
screaming, merging violently with the lava.

If life only begins  
after witnessing another’s death,  
I have seen it.  
Yet life says:  
“It’s your turn.”  
For a time,  
I am shrouded in pain,  
my body reaching toward that patch of scalp,  
as I long for the wings of a bird.

The pain subsides.  
From the beginning to now,  
how much phosphate will crystallize  
from this surging terminus?  
People never return,  
just as that patch of scalp  
will never grow hair again.

Your anger is too enduring,  
born from the core of the earth.  
Billions of years of bones  
cannot fill the vent holes of your epidermis.  
Your cause is not biological—  
lice merely shake themselves off.  
It is something deeper,  
a geologic, elemental reason,  
an eternal fury  
that can only destroy itself.

Bright yellow peels back the dark-gray shell,  
the surging flare—  
will it erupt like Pompeii?  
This is no hell;  
this is an orchard of destruction,  
with humid air,  
birds and the deep green of rainforest.  
The wind brushes my scalp,  
a cool tickling.  
As I slide down,  
I lose more,  
and gain certain things,  
until the end.

I think I have begun to live.
