You drift  
on the sea of life,  
arms raised high,  
stammering like  
a muted festival of music.  
What do you want to say?  
A knife lodged inside—  
you tremble,  
from within outward,  
slowly cutting your throat.

They sent me to save you,  
stepping aside to yield 
how generous —
The embrace of the Mayflower 
tailcoat, top hat, cane,  
like a quality inspection.  
I am oil,  
the first barrel  
of a billion years’ sediment.

Every child  
is the Messiah of the family.  
Your love  
drags me into deep water,  
straining like labor,  
the heartbeat of instruments  
snapping,  
beep—beep echoes.

This time  
I die at birth
The eggs that once twisted  
your entrails  
have all been swept away by the tide.

Mother,  
with the sacrifice of your stomach and intestines,  
kick wildly.  
A shark’s pale grave,  
like a torpedo,  
targets each of us.
