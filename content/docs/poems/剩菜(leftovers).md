In the old days, when poverty  
still allowed a slice of meat,  
you pinned a price on every piece.  
Dishes slick with a centimeter of grease,  
day after day of slaughter,  
life grinding you down.

Now food runs scarce,  
no meat to be bought,  
only the old method remains.  
Your blade is still sharp,  
hard enough to keep a family alive  
for decades.  
Life is all about trade-offs
You are a survivor.

In the heat of summer,  
nameless irritations  
cling to your face like flies.  
On the table, gray meat.  
Saliva tangled with soy sauce,  
shreds of flesh tangled with fat.  
Fullness gives you a flicker of ease.

Mixed with grains of rice and soup,  
you toss away my bones.  
The garbage exhales its sour rot.  
Flies swarm in disorder,  
mosquitoes spread across the walls,  
the cicadas’ endless static.  
And you leave behind  
a flat, irritating burp.
